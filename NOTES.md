# Mortens noter til "5 lines of code"

## Rules
### Five Lines
### Either Call or Pass
Either ***call*** methods on an object or ***pass*** the object, not both
### If Only at the Start
### Function naming
- Honest - Describe the functions intention
- Complete - Capture all the functions does
- Understandable - Be undestandable for someone working in the domain
